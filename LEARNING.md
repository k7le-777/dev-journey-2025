**Date:** 16 October 2025
**Time Invested:** 17 hours

### What I Built
- Complete REST API with Node.js + Express (300+ lines)
- PostgreSQL database integration (Supabase)
- 5 working endpoints serving real data
- Database connection pooling (db.js)
- Environment variable security (.env)

### Major Debugging Wins
1. **Port Conflict:** Discovered Apple uses port 5000 → Changed to 3001
2. **Database URL:** Fixed Supabase connection string format
3. **SQL Query:** Corrected column reference (overall_score)

### New Concepts Mastered
- Backend vs Frontend (waiter analogy clicked!)
- REST API principles (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- JSON data format (how computers talk)
- Environment variables (secrets protection)
- Database queries (SQL basics)
- API endpoints (menu items concept)
- Port numbers (doors on computer)

### Testing Success
- Health check: ✅ Working
- All jobs: ✅ Returns 8 jobs
- Single job: ✅ Returns details
- Stats: ✅ Returns metrics
- Search: ✅ Keyword matching

### Aha Moments
- Backend is like a waiter taking orders!
- .gitignore at root protects entire project
- Environment variables = secret notebook
- JSON = structured data computers understand
- One API can serve web, mobile, desktop apps

### What Clicked Today
Understanding the flow: Browser → API → Database → API → Browser
Seeing real JSON data return from my own API was incredible!

### Challenges Overcome
- Initially confused by all the syntax
- Port conflicts seemed scary but were simple to fix
- SQL errors taught me to read error messages carefully
- curl commands felt weird at first, now they make sense

### Tomorrow's Goal
Build React frontend to display this data beautifully!
Make it look like a real website, not just JSON text.

### Reflection
Alhamdulillah - I built a REAL backend API that could serve thousands!
The same technology major companies use. This is no longer beginner work.
Feeling confident about frontend tomorrow.

### Dua
Ya Allah, grant me understanding and make this knowledge beneficial
for the ummah. Make this sadaqah jariyah that continues to help people
find halal income and dignified work. Ameen. 🤲

---

## Python Concepts Mastered Today

### New Concepts (Not in Day 6):

**1. Helper Functions (DRY Principle)**
```python
def get_positive_number(prompt, allow_zero=False):
    # Reusable validation logic
    # Called 6 times in get_zakatable_assets()
```
- Don't Repeat Yourself
- Write once, use many times
- More maintainable code

**2. Default Parameters**
```python
def function(required_param, optional_param=False):
```
- Parameters can have default values
- Makes functions more flexible
- Used in helper function

**3. Using min() Built-in**
```python
nisab_used = min(gold_nisab, silver_nisab)
```
- Python has powerful built-in functions
- Always prefer built-ins over custom logic

**4. Module-Level Constants**
```python
GOLD_NISAB_GRAMS = 85
SILVER_NISAB_GRAMS = 595
ZAKAT_RATE = 0.025
```
- All caps naming convention
- Single source of truth
- Easy to update in one place

**5. Multi-line String Formatting**
```python
total = (
    assets["cash"] +
    gold_value +
    silver_value +
    # ...
)
```
- Improves readability
- Python allows multi-line expressions

### Reinforced Concepts (From Day 6):

- Input validation with try/except
- While loops with break
- Dictionaries for structured data
- F-strings for formatting
- Functions with multiple returns
- Clear variable naming

---

## Islamic Knowledge Deepened

### Zakat Fiqh Implemented:

**1. Nisab Calculation**
- Gold: 85 grams (scholarly consensus)
- Silver: 595 grams (scholarly consensus)
- Use lower threshold (more charitable)

**2. Zakatable Assets**
- Cash and savings ✓
- Gold and silver (by weight) ✓
- Business inventory ✓
- Halal investments ✓
- Receivable debts ✓

**3. Non-Zakatable Assets**
- Primary residence
- Personal transportation
- Clothing and furniture
- Work tools

**4. Critical Islamic Ruling**
- Wealth **≥ nisab** means zakat IS due
- Not **> nisab** (equal counts!)
- This was a key learning moment

**5. Rate and Hawl**
- 2.5% of total zakatable wealth
- Must be held for one lunar year (hawl)
- Both conditions required

**6. Eligible Recipients (Quran 9:60)**
All 8 categories implemented in display:
1. The poor (al-fuqara)
2. The needy (al-masakin)
3. Zakat administrators
4. Those whose hearts are to be reconciled
5. Those in bondage
6. Those in debt
7. In the cause of Allah
8. The wayfarer

---

## Challenges Overcome

### Challenge 1: Multiple Asset Types
**Problem:** Need to collect 6 different assets with validation for each  
**Initial thought:** Copy-paste validation 6 times  
**Better solution:** Create helper function, call it 6 times  
**Lesson:** DRY principle - write once, use many times

**Before (would have been ~80 lines):**
```python
# Repeated 6 times:
while True:
    try:
        value = float(input("..."))
        if value >= 0:
            break
    except:
        print("Error")
```

**After (15 lines + 6 calls = 21 lines total):**
```python
def get_positive_number(prompt, allow_zero=False):
    # Single implementation
    
assets["cash"] = get_positive_number("...", True)
assets["gold"] = get_positive_number("...", True)
# etc.
```

**Saved ~60 lines and made code maintainable!**

---

### Challenge 2: Islamic Ruling - Equal to Nisab
**Problem:** Does zakat apply when wealth EQUALS nisab?  
**My initial assumption:** No, only when ABOVE  
**Correct ruling:** Yes, when AT or ABOVE nisab  
**Code implication:** Use `>=` not `>`

**This taught me:** Always verify Islamic rulings before implementing. Research Specialist was crucial here.

---

### Challenge 3: Gold/Silver Conversion
**Problem:** User enters grams, but we calculate in currency  
**Solution:** Convert at calculation time  
**Math:** `grams × price_per_gram = currency_value`

**Implementation:**
```python
gold_value = assets["gold_grams"] * gold_price
total_wealth = assets["cash"] + gold_value + silver_value + ...
```

**Lesson:** Sometimes you store data in one format (grams) but calculate in another (currency). Plan data flow carefully.

---

### Challenge 4: Dictionary Key Consistency
**Problem:** Almost used "stocks_and_investments" in one place and "investments" in another  
**Caught it:** Because I remembered Day 6 typo bug  
**Prevention:** Copy-paste key names instead of retyping  
**Lesson:** Typos in dictionary keys create hard-to-find bugs

---

## Code Quality Evolution

**Comparing Day 6 to Day 7:**

### Day 6 Code:
```python
def get_expense_details():
    while True:
        # Validation logic
        break
    description = input("...")
    return {"amount": x, "description": y}
```
✅ Good, functional

### Day 7 Code:
```python
def get_positive_number(prompt, allow_zero=False):
    """Reusable helper with docstring"""
    # Generic validation logic
    
def get_zakatable_assets():
    """Uses helper 6 times"""
    assets["cash"] = get_positive_number("...", True)
    # Clean, DRY
```
✅✅ Better architecture, reusable, maintainable

**I'm not just writing code that works - I'm writing code that's WELL-DESIGNED.**

---

## Git Workflow Mastery

**My commit strategy today:**

1. Initialize structure (template)
2. Function 1 → commit
3. Function 2 → commit
...
9. Complete integration → commit

**9 commits = 9 logical milestones**

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Can revert any single function if broken
- Clear development story
- Easy to review changes
- Professional portfolio evidence

**Commit message quality:**
- Descriptive titles
- Multi-line explanations for complex commits
- References Islamic principles
- Shows understanding of WHY, not just WHAT

---

## Islamic Integration - Code as Dawah

**Every function teaches Islam:**

**`display_introduction()`:**
- Explains zakat as pillar of Islam
- Educates about nisab
- Cites Quranic foundation

**`calculate_zakat()`:**
- Implements 2.5% rate from hadith
- Respects nisab threshold from Sunnah
- Handles edge cases Islamically

**`display_results()`:**
- Lists 8 eligible recipients from Quran
- Reminds about hawl requirement
- Encourages sadaqah if not due
- Ends with dua and JazakAllahu khairan

**This calculator doesn't just compute numbers - it educates users about their Islamic obligations.**

**A non-Muslim seeing this code would learn:**
- Islam has structured charity system
- Wealth purification is obligatory
- Specific thresholds and rates
- Care for the poor is central to faith

**This is dawah through excellent code.**

---

## User Experience Design

**Professional touches:**
- Bismillah opening
- Step-by-step progression (STEP 1, STEP 2)
- Pause points (`input("Press Enter...")`)
- Progress indicators (✓ checkmarks)
- Emojis for visual sections (💵 💰 🥇)
- Clear boundaries (=== lines)
- Educational content throughout
- Closing dua

**This isn't just functional - it's delightful to use.**

---

## Testing Methodology

**Tested both paths:**

**Path 1: Zakat IS due**
- Wealth: £10,000
- Nisab: £386.75
- Result: £250.00 zakat
- Display: Educational next steps

**Path 2: Zakat NOT due**
- Wealth: £200
- Nisab: £386.75
- Result: No zakat
- Display: Encouragement for sadaqah

**Edge cases tested:**
- Wealth EXACTLY at nisab (zakat due ✓)
- Zero wealth (no zakat ✓)
- Invalid inputs (loops back ✓)
- Zero assets (handled gracefully ✓)

**Professional QA mindset from Day 1.**

---

## Comparison to Day 6

| Aspect | Day 6 (Expense Cat.) | Day 7 (Zakat Calc.) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Lines | 167 | 342 (+105%) |
| Functions | 5 | 8 (+60%) |
| Helper funcs | 0 | 1 (NEW!) |
| Complexity | Medium | High |

**I'm building MORE and building BETTER each day.**

---

## What I'm Proud Of

1. **Helper function architecture** - Wrote reusable code, not repetitive code
2. **Islamic accuracy** - Verified every ruling before implementing
3. **User experience** - Thoughtful pauses, education, guidance
4. **Commit quality** - Every commit tells a clear story
5. **Code clarity** - Chose readable over clever (Approach 1 vs 2)
6. **Comprehensive display** - Not just numbers, but education and next steps

**This isn't beginner code anymore. This is intermediate-level, purpose-driven development.**

---

## Tomorrow's Plan (Day 8)

**Options:**

**Option 1: Third micro-project** (keep building foundations)
- Ideas: Salah time calculator, Hijri date converter, Qibla finder

**Option 2: Start planning Mizaan MVP** (transition to main project)
- Now have 2 strong components (expense categorizer + zakat calculator)
- Could begin architecting full Mizaan system

**Option 3: Code review and refactoring** (improve existing code)
- Review both programs
- Identify improvements
- Learn refactoring techniques

**I'll discuss with mentor and decide.**

---

## Questions for Mentor

1. **Architecture:** Should I have split any functions into smaller ones?
2. **Islamic validation:** Should I add more detailed zakat rulings (debts deductible)?
3. **API integration:** Ready to learn how to fetch live gold/silver prices?
4. **Next project:** Another micro-project or start Mizaan planning?
5. **Code style:** Any Python conventions I should adopt?

---

## Reflections & Realizations

### 1. Helper functions are game-changers
Writing `get_positive_number()` once and using it 6 times felt incredible. This is the power of abstraction - write once, benefit many times.

### 2. Islamic scholarship enhances code quality
Having clear Islamic specifications (nisab weights, rates, recipients) gave me precise requirements. Religious knowledge translates to better technical specifications.

### 3. Building in public (Git) creates accountability
Every commit is visible. This makes me write better commit messages, cleaner code, and more thoughtful implementations. Public accountability improves quality.

### 4. Complexity is manageable when broken down
342 lines seems overwhelming. But broken into 8 functions of ~15-40 lines each? Totally manageable. Software engineering is about decomposition.

### 5. Purpose drives excellence
I'm not building random calculators. I'm building tools that could help Muslims fulfill obligations to Allah. This purpose makes me care more about quality, accuracy, and user experience.

### 6. Growth is exponential, not linear
Day 6: Struggled with basic validation  
Day 7: Built helper functions and complex flows  
**This is exponential learning.** Each day builds on previous days compoundingly.

---

## Gratitude & Dua

**Alhamdulillah for:**
- The ability to build tools that serve Allah's commands
- Understanding complex Islamic rulings enough to code them
- Progress from 0 Python knowledge to 500+ lines in 2 days
- Mentor's Socratic guidance (teaching patterns, not solutions)
- Brain that can translate worship into algorithms

**Dua:**
Ya Allah, I built a tool for calculating zakat - make it accurate, beneficial, and a means of helping Muslims fulfill their obligations. If this code has errors, guide me to fix them. If it helps even one person calculate zakat correctly, make it sadaqah jariyah for me. Protect me from pride - this knowledge is from You alone. Make my code a form of worship and service to Your deen. Guide me to always build with excellence (ihsan) and sincerity (ikhlas). Ameen.

## Day 6 - First Python Program Complete! 🎉

**Date:** 15 OCT 2025  
**Time Invested:** ~24 hours  
**Lines of Code:** 150+  
**Git Commits:** 6 professional commits  
**Branch:** feature/expense-categoriser → merged to main

---

## Major Accomplishment

**✅ Built my first complete Python program from scratch: Islamic Expense Categorizer**

This is not a tutorial copy-paste. This is a working program I built function by function, debugging independently, and problem-solving through real bugs. It implements Islamic spending categories from my research into functional code.

---

## What I Built - Technical Specs

**5 Functions totaling ~150 lines:**

1. **`display_categories()`** (12 lines)
   - Displays four Islamic spending categories
   - User education about Quranic framework

2. **`get_expense_details()`** (18 lines)
   - Gets amount and description from user
   - Validates amount is numeric using try/except
   - Validates amount is positive (rejects zero/negatives)
   - Loops until valid input using break
   - Returns expense dictionary

3. **`select_category()`** (15 lines)
   - Displays category menu (1-4)
   - Validates user selection
   - Loops until valid choice
   - Returns category name (not number)

4. **`display_summary(expenses)`** (40 lines)
   - Groups expenses by Islamic category
   - Calculates category totals
   - Calculates grand total
   - Handles empty categories gracefully
   - Displays formatted summary with emojis
   - Shows warning for Israf spending with Quranic verse

5. **`main()`** (35 lines)
   - Welcome message with Quranic foundation
   - Main expense entry loop
   - Integrates all 4 functions
   - Stores expenses in list
   - Calls summary when done

**Features demonstrated:**

- Error handling (try/except ValueError)
- Loop control (while True, break, if/elif/else)
- Data structures (lists of dictionaries)
- String formatting (f-strings with .2f)
- User experience (clear messages, emojis, formatting)
- Islamic integration (Quranic categories, hadith reminders)

---

## Python Concepts Mastered

**Data Types:**
- `str` (strings): descriptions, category names
- `float` (decimals): expense amounts
- `bool` (boolean): validation flags
- `dict` (dictionary): expense objects with key-value pairs
- `list` (array): collection of expense dictionaries

**Control Flow:**
- `if/elif/else`: Conditional logic for validation and categorization
- `while True`: Infinite loops with break conditions
- `for loop`: Iterating through lists (categories, expenses)
- `break`: Exiting loops when condition met
- `return`: Exiting functions and sending data back

**Functions:**
- Defining with `def function_name():`
- Parameters (passing data in)
- Return values (sending data out)
- Docstrings for documentation
- Single responsibility principle

**Error Handling:**
- `try/except ValueError`: Catching conversion errors
- Graceful degradation (helpful error messages)
- Loop-based retry logic

**String Formatting:**
- F-strings: `f"£{amount:.2f}"`
- Format specifiers: `.2f` for 2 decimal places
- Escape characters: `\n` for newlines
- Unicode emojis: 📊, ⚠️, ✓, •

**Data Structure Operations:**
- Creating dictionaries: `{"key": value}`
- Accessing dictionary values: `expense["amount"]`
- Creating lists: `[]`
- Appending to lists: `expenses.append(expense)`
- Iterating nested structures

---

## Git Workflow Mastered

**Professional branching strategy:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/expense-categoriser  # Create feature branch
# ... make changes ...
git add file.py                              # Stage changes
git commit -m "Descriptive message"          # Commit logically
# ... repeat for each function ...
git checkout main                            # Switch to main
git merge feature/expense-categoriser        # Merge feature
git push origin main                         # Push to remote
git branch -d feature/expense-categoriser    # Delete branch
```

**6 commits made:**

**Each commit:**
- ✅ Clear, descriptive message explaining WHY
- ✅ References Mizaan feature it builds toward
- ✅ One logical change per commit
- ✅ Shows incremental development
- ✅ Professional quality

---

## Challenges Overcome & Lessons Learned

### Challenge 1: Infinite Loop in Input Validation
**Problem:** Loop continued even after valid input  
**Cause:** Forgot to use `break` after successful validation  
**Solution:** Added `break` statement when validation passes  
**Lesson:** Loops need explicit exit conditions; `while True` requires `break`

**Before:**
```python
while True:
    try:
        amount = float(input("Amount: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid!")
    description = input("Description: ")  # ❌ Always runs!
```

**After:**
```python
while True:
    try:
        amount = float(input("Amount: "))
        if amount > 0:
            break  # ✅ Exit when valid
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid!")
description = input("Description: ")  # ✅ Only after valid amount
```

---

### Challenge 2: Positive Number Validation
**Problem:** Initially only checked numeric type, allowed zero/negatives  
**Cause:** Didn't think through all edge cases  
**Solution:** Added `if amount_number > 0` check before break  
**Lesson:** Validation needs both type checking AND logical value checking

**Edge cases considered:**
- Text input ("abc") → ValueError caught
- Negative (-50) → Rejected with message
- Zero (0) → Rejected with message  
- Valid positive (50.50) → Accepted

---

### Challenge 3: Variable Name Typo Bug (Critical!)
**Problem:** Categories showed "(No expenses)" even when expenses existed  
**Cause:** Typo - set `has_expense` but checked `has_expenses`  
**Root issue:** Python allows creating variables anywhere without declaration  
**Solution:** Fixed variable name to be consistent  

**The bug:**
```python
has_expenses = False  # Line 34
if match:
    has_expense = True  # Line 38 - Created NEW variable!
if not has_expenses:  # Line 45 - Still False!
    print("No expenses")
```

**The fix:**
```python
has_expenses = False
if match:
    has_expenses = True  # ✅ Same variable
if not has_expenses:  # ✅ Correctly updated
    print("No expenses")
```

**Lesson:** 
- Variable name typos create NEW variables in Python (no error!)
- Copy-paste variable names instead of retyping
- Test immediately after writing functions
- Use descriptive names that are hard to mistype

---

### Challenge 4: Understanding F-Strings
**Problem:** Initially confused about `f"£{amount:.2f}"`  
**Cause:** New concept, multiple things happening in one line  
**Solution:** Broke down into parts: f-string, variable insertion, format specifier  
**Lesson:** F-strings are incredibly powerful for readable string formatting

**Mastered:**
- `f"text {variable}"` - variable insertion
- `f"£{amount:.2f}"` - 2 decimal places for currency
- `f"\n📊 {category}:"` - combining escape chars, emojis, variables

---

## Code Quality Analysis

**What makes this code good:**
- ✅ Each function has single, clear purpose
- ✅ Descriptive variable names (`amount_number`, not `x`)
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation
- ✅ Helpful error messages for users
- ✅ Professional formatting and emojis
- ✅ Docstrings documenting each function
- ✅ Quranic principles integrated authentically

**What could be improved (future iterations):**
- Extract category list to constant at top (DRY principle)
- Add ability to edit/delete entered expenses
- Save expenses to file for persistence (JSON or CSV)
- More sophisticated balance algorithm (percentage-based)
- Unit tests using pytest
- Command-line arguments for non-interactive mode

**But for Day 6 as a complete beginner: This is exceptional.**

---

## Islamic Integration - Code as Ibadah

**Quranic principles implemented in code:**

1. **Categories from research:** Daruriyyat, Hajiyyat, Tahsiniyyat, Israf
   - Not arbitrary - directly from Islamic scholarship
   - Each category represents divine guidance on spending

2. **Warning system with Quranic reminder:**
   - Detects Israf (wasteful) spending
   - Displays Quran 17:26: "Do not spend wastefully"
   - Educational, not judgmental

3. **User education through interaction:**
   - Users learn Islamic framework by categorizing
   - Reinforces Quranic balance principle (25:67)
   - Makes abstract concepts tangible

4. **Foundation for Mizaan balance algorithm:**
   - This categorization logic will power Mizaan
   - Balance score will measure deviation from ideal proportions
   - Quranic guidance translated to mathematical formula

**This proves:** Divine revelation can be implemented as working code. Islamic scholarship guides algorithmic design.

---

## Testing Methodology

**How I tested each function:**

1. **Isolated function testing:**
   - Added temporary test code at bottom
   - Ran: `python learning/day6/expense_categoriser.py`
   - Verified expected behavior

2. **Valid input testing:**
   - Entered correct data types and values
   - Verified proper processing and output

3. **Invalid input testing (Edge cases):**
   - Text when expecting numbers → Error caught, helpful message
   - Negative amounts → Rejected with reason
   - Zero amount → Rejected 
   - Invalid menu choices → Looped back with message

4. **Integration testing:**
   - Ran complete program end-to-end
   - Multiple expenses across categories
   - Verified summary calculations correct
   - Confirmed Israf warning triggers

**This is professional QA thinking from Day 1.**

## Questions for Mentor

1. **Code style:** Is my formatting/naming convention good? What should I improve?
2. **Commit granularity:** Are my commits too small, too large, or just right?
3. **Comments:** Should I add more inline comments? Less? Different style?
4. **Error handling:** Is try/except the best approach or should I validate differently?
5. **Function design:** Should I break any functions into smaller ones?
6. **Next challenge:** What concept should I tackle in Project 2 (Zakat Calculator)?

## Reflections & Key Realizations

### 1. Programming is puzzle-solving, not memorization
I didn't memorize Python syntax. I understood the PROBLEM (get valid input, categorize, display summary) and figured out HOW using the tools (loops, conditionals, data structures). This is the right learning approach.

### 2. Bugs are the best teachers
The typo bug (`has_expense` vs `has_expenses`) taught me more about Python variable scoping than any tutorial could. Debugging forces you to understand code execution deeply.

### 3. Small, frequent commits >>> one big commit
Six focused commits tell a better story than one "finished project" commit. Each is understandable, revertible, and demonstrates clear thinking.

### 4. Purpose-driven development is motivating
This isn't abstract practice - it's building toward Mizaan. Every function gets me closer to helping Muslims spend according to Quranic guidance. Purpose accelerates learning.

### 5. Islamic principles enhance code quality
Having clear Quranic categories gave me precise requirements. Instead of vague "spending types", I had divinely guided specifications. This clarity improved my code architecture.

### 6. Testing immediately saves time later
Testing each function in isolation before integration prevented cascade failures. Finding bugs early is exponentially easier than debugging a complete broken system.

### 7. Professional habits compound
- Writing good commit messages is now automatic
- Input validation is my first thought, not an afterthought
- Documentation happens during coding, not after
- Git workflow feels natural

**These habits will serve me for decades.**

## Gratitude & Dua

**Alhamdulillah for:**
- The ability to learn and understand new concepts
- Patience during debugging frustration
- Clear Islamic guidance shaping requirements
- Progress from zero Python to working program in one day
- Mentor's Socratic method (learning by discovery, not spoon-feeding)
- Brain that can translate Quranic principles into algorithms

**Dua:**
Ya Allah, make this knowledge beneficial for the ummah. Make my code serve Your guidance and help Muslims live according to Your commands. Grant me excellence (ihsan) in both technical skill and Islamic authenticity. Make this project sadaqah jariyah that continues benefiting people after I'm gone. Protect me from arrogance and showing off - let my work speak for itself. Guide me to always prioritize quality over speed, and purpose over profit. Ameen.

## Final Thought

**From "I've never written Python" to "I built a working program with 150+ lines" in one day.**

**This is not about natural talent. This is about:**
- Clear learning methodology (Socratic, incremental)
- Productive struggle (debugging builds understanding)
- Purpose-driven motivation (serving the ummah)
- Professional habits from Day 1 (Git, documentation, testing)
- Islamic scholarship providing clarity

**If I can do this in Day 6, imagine Day 45.**

**The journey from beginner to employable developer is absolutely achievable.**

**Bismillah - onward to Day 7.** 🚀

### What I Learned

**About Professional Development:**
- Pivoting early with clear documentation is strategic, not weak
- Separation of concerns (research vs. development) improves quality
- Planning before coding prevents wasted effort
- Git history tells your professional story

**About Islamic Economics:**
- The Quran provides a complete economic framework, not vague spiritual advice
- Balance (qawam) can be translated into algorithmic logic
- Zakat calculation requires precise scholarship, not estimates
- Empowerment through work is higher than charity alone
- Every economic decision has spiritual weight

**About Git and Documentation:**
- Commit messages should explain *why*, not just *what*
- Good README files are marketing materials for your portfolio
- Documentation before coding (README-driven development) clarifies thinking
- Public repositories require polished, professional content

### Technical Skills Practiced
- Git: init, add, commit, push, branching concepts
- Markdown: Professional documentation formatting
- Repository organization: Folder structure, file naming
- Project planning: Breaking large projects into MVP features

### Islamic Scholarship Applied
- Researched primary sources (Quran, authentic hadith)
- Consulted contemporary fiqh for modern applications
- Calculated current nisab thresholds
- Developed verification criteria for halal income

### Challenges Overcome
- **Initial confusion about pivot:** Resolved by documenting strategic reasoning clearly
- **Overwhelm from project scope:** Managed by focusing on MVP features only
- **Balancing Islamic authenticity with technical feasibility:** Addressed through research specialist separation

### Tomorrow's Plan (Day 2)

**Morning (2 hours):**
- First Python micro-project: Expense Categorizer
- Practice Git branching with features

### Questions for Mentor 
1. How granular should my commits be for micro-projects?
2. When should I create a branch vs. commit to main?
3. How do I structure Python functions for best practices?

### Reflections

**Alhamdulillah** for the guidance to pursue this path. Today I realized:

1. **Building with purpose is energizing:** Knowing these projects will help real Muslims makes every hour worthwhile

2. **Islamic scholarship enhances development:** Deep understanding of deen *improves* my technical work, not distracts from it

3. **Professional habits start Day 1:** Good Git messages, clean documentation, and organized structure compound over 45 days

4. **Team approach works:** Having specialized "team members" (research specialist, development mentor) feels like real professional development

### Gratitude
Ya Allah, make this work purely for Your sake, beneficial for the ummah, and sadaqah jariyah that continues reward after I'm gone. Grant me excellence (ihsan) in both technical skill and Islamic authenticity. Ameen.
