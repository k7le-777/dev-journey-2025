**Date:** 9 January 2025
**Total Time:** ~5 days  (setup, planning, research)

### Major Accomplishments

**Morning:**
- ✅ Environment setup (Git, Python, Node.js)
- ✅ First repository created
- ✅ Initial commits with professional messages

**Afternoon:**
- ✅ Strategic pivot to Mizaan + Rizq (documented in PIVOT.md)
- ✅ Complete project planning (MIZAAN_RIZQ_PROJECT_PLAN.md)
- ✅ Repository structure organized
- ✅ Created Research Specialist team member

**Evening:**
- ✅ Comprehensive Islamic research completed
- ✅ 20+ Quranic verses and hadith compiled
- ✅ Zakat calculation specifications documented
- ✅ Halal income criteria established
- ✅ Current nisab thresholds calculated

### What I Learned

**About Professional Development:**
- Pivoting early with clear documentation is strategic, not weak
- Separation of concerns (research vs. development) improves quality
- Planning before coding prevents wasted effort
- Git history tells your professional story

**About Islamic Economics:**
- The Quran provides a complete economic framework, not vague spiritual advice
- Balance (qawam) can be translated into algorithmic logic
- Zakat calculation requires precise scholarship, not estimates
- Empowerment through work is higher than charity alone
- Every economic decision has spiritual weight

**About Git and Documentation:**
- Commit messages should explain *why*, not just *what*
- Good README files are marketing materials for your portfolio
- Documentation before coding (README-driven development) clarifies thinking
- Public repositories require polished, professional content

### Technical Skills Practiced
- Git: init, add, commit, push, branching concepts
- Markdown: Professional documentation formatting
- Repository organization: Folder structure, file naming
- Project planning: Breaking large projects into MVP features

### Islamic Scholarship Applied
- Researched primary sources (Quran, authentic hadith)
- Consulted contemporary fiqh for modern applications
- Calculated current nisab thresholds
- Developed verification criteria for halal income

### Challenges Overcome
- **Initial confusion about pivot:** Resolved by documenting strategic reasoning clearly
- **Overwhelm from project scope:** Managed by focusing on MVP features only
- **Balancing Islamic authenticity with technical feasibility:** Addressed through research specialist separation

### Tomorrow's Plan (Day 2)

**Morning (2 hours):**
- First Python micro-project: Expense Categorizer
- Practice Git branching with features
- Multiple commits with professional messages

**Afternoon (1 hour):**
- Test and refine the categorizer
- Add error handling
- Document the code

**Evening (30 min):**
- Update learning journal
- Review commit history with mentor
- Plan Day 3 micro-project

### Questions for Mentor 
1. How granular should my commits be for micro-projects?
2. When should I create a branch vs. commit to main?
3. How do I structure Python functions for best practices?

### Reflections

**Alhamdulillah** for the guidance to pursue this path. Today I realized:

1. **Building with purpose is energizing:** Knowing these projects will help real Muslims makes every hour worthwhile

2. **Islamic scholarship enhances development:** Deep understanding of deen *improves* my technical work, not distracts from it

3. **Professional habits start Day 1:** Good Git messages, clean documentation, and organized structure compound over 45 days

4. **Team approach works:** Having specialized "team members" (research specialist, development mentor) feels like real professional development

### Gratitude
Ya Allah, make this work purely for Your sake, beneficial for the ummah, and sadaqah jariyah that continues reward after I'm gone. Grant me excellence (ihsan) in both technical skill and Islamic authenticity. Ameen.
