**Date:** [08-10-2025]

### What I Built Today
- Set up complete development environment (Git, Python, Node.js)
- Created dev-journey-2025 repository
- Wrote comprehensive README outlining 45-day mission
- Made my first professional commit
- Connected local repository to GitHub

### What I Struggled With
- Whether to stick to computer terminal or IDE terminal. I'll see throughout this journey what ill be comfortable with

### How I Solved It
- just let things flow and not overthink about the future too much.

### What I Learned
- i can focus on the 'now' and not burnout for what i cant control.

#### Git Fundamentals
- `git init`: [Explain what this does in your own words]
- `git add`: [Explain what this does in your own words]
- `git commit`: [Explain what this does in your own words]
- `git push`: [Explain what this does in your own words]

#### Why Good Commit Messages Matter
- Allows easy readability to read commit history. - clean and easy code.

#### Environment Setup
- python im yet to discover. i have toucehd javascript but my thoughts are javascript is the vanilla of python
- Git allows communication to github through local terminal
- Node ?


### Questions I Still Have
1. is there a crashcourse for good commit messages?
2. difference between origin and main branch?

### Tomorrow's Goal
- Build a simple calculator in Python
- Practice Git branching
- Make at least 5 quality commits

- I cant wait to start on this journey especailly that this project is not just beneficial for my skills development  but also meaningful for purpose in life!
- What worries me the most is the dedicating time ill need to put into this and finding balance with family, career, work, socials.
