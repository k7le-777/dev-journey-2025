# My 45-Day Software Development Journey

**Start Date:** 08-10-2025 
**Mission:** Building tools that embody Quranic economic principles and empower the Muslim ummah.

## Strategic Evolution

This repository documents my journey from beginner to junior developer, including a strategic pivot from an educational access tool to comprehensive Islamic economic empowerment platforms. (See [PIVOT.md](PIVOT.md) for full reasoning)

## Current Project Direction

### Project 1: Mizaan - Balanced Spending Tracker
**Quranic Foundation:** *"Those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium way between those extremes."* (25:67)

**Problem:** Muslims lack tools that integrate Quranic economic ethics into daily spending decisions.

**Solution:** A spending tracker that categorizes expenses by Islamic principles, calculates zakat automatically, and helps users achieve the Quranic balance between excess and miserliness.

**Impact Goal:** Help Muslims manage wealth according to divine guidance while fulfilling their zakat obligations accurately.

### Project 2: Rizq - Halal Income Opportunity Platform
**Quranic Foundation:** *"It is He who made the earth tame for you - so walk among its slopes and eat of His provision."* (67:15)

**Problem:** Muslims struggle to find verified halal income sources that provide dignified work and self-reliance.

**Solution:** An aggregation platform that connects Muslims with halal job opportunities, freelance work, and micro-business ideas, emphasizing empowerment over dependency.

**Impact Goal:** Help Muslims find dignified halal income, moving from charity receivers to charity givers.

**Backend:** Flask/FastAPI, Node.js, Express  
**Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS  
**Database:** PostgreSQL, SQLite  
**Tools:** Git/GitHub, Docker, REST APIs, pytest, Jest

## Daily Commitments
- Minimum 3 quality commits per day
- Learning journal after each session
- Code review every 2-3 days
- Documentation as I build
- Socratic learning method (understand, don't copy-paste)

## Success Metrics

**Technical:**
- 2 deployed projects solving real problems
- 200+ professional commits with clear history
- GitHub profile with 45+ days of consistent activity
